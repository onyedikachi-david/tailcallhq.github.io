## Installing the Tailcall CLI

<>
  <p>
    <span>You can install the latest version - </span>
    <Version /> <span>by using</span> <b>NPM</b>.
  </p>
</>

### NPM

1. If you don't already have **nodejs** installed, you can find the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs).
2. Install Tailcall by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm i -g @tailcallhq/tailcall
   ```
3. To verify the correct installation of Tailcall, run:

   ```bash
   tailcall
   ```

   :::note
   Do not use the `--force` flag during npm installations, as it ignores installing platform-specific builds.
   :::

### Yarn

1. Install Tailcall by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   yarn global add @tailcallhq/tailcall
   ```
2. To verify the correct installation of Tailcall, run:

   ```bash
   tailcall
   ```

### Homebrew

1. If you don't already have Homebrew installed, you can find the instructions [here](https://brew.sh/).

2. Add the Tailcall repository to Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   brew tap tailcallhq/tailcall
   brew install tailcall
   ```
3. To verify the correct installation of Tailcall, run:

   ```bash
   tailcall
   ```

4. After completing the installation, perform **upgrades** with:

   ```bash
   brew update
   brew upgrade tailcall
   ```

### Curl

Follow the steps below to manually install the cli on your system:

<InstallCommand />

This command fetches and executes the Tailcall installation script. The `~/.tailcall` directory contains the installed files.

Upon completion of the installation, extend your `PATH` environment variable to include the `~/.tailcall/bin` directory:

```bash
# export PATH=$PATH:~/.tailcall/bin
```

### Docker

To install Tailcall with Docker, follow the steps below. Please note that currently, this installation method only works on Linux/amd64 systems. Before starting, make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If not, download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

1. Pull the latest Tailcall Docker image using the following command:

   <CodeBlock language="bash">
     {/*  prettier-ignore-start  */}
     docker pull tailcall.docker.scarf.sh/tailcallhq/tailcall/tc-server:
     <Version />
     {/*  prettier-ignore-end  */}
   </CodeBlock>

   This command fetches the latest version of the Tailcall Docker image from the Docker registry.

2. Run the Tailcall Docker container with the following command:

   <CodeBlock language="bash">
     {/* prettier-ignore-start  */}
     docker run -d --name graphql-server -p 8000:8000 \ -v /path/to/your/configs:/etc/tailcall \ --entrypoint "/bin/sh"
     \ ghcr.io/tailcallhq/tailcall/tc-server:
     <Version /> \ -c "export PATH=\$PATH:~/.tailcall/bin && tailcall start /etc/tailcall/config.graphql"
     {/* prettier-ignore-end  */}
   </CodeBlock>

   This command launches the GraphQL server in a Docker container, exposing the GraphQL endpoint on port 8080.

## Initializing a GraphQL project

Once you have installed the Tailcall binaries, you can simply use the [init](cli.md#init) command to initialize your GraphQL project.

```bash
tailcall init <directory>
```

The command will ask you a few questions and based on your input bootstrap a new GraphQL project with a few files:

1. `.tailcallrc.schema.json`: Provides autocomplete in your editor when the configuration is written in `json` or `yml` format.
2. `.graphqlrc.yml`: An IDE configuration that references your GraphQL configuration (if it's in `.graphql` format) and the following `.tailcallrc.graphql`.
3. `.tailcallrc.graphql`: Contains Tailcall specific auto-completions for `.graphql` format.
4. `main.graphql`: This is your root configuration that contains

## Writing a GraphQL Configuration

For our first example, we are going to compose a GraphQL schema from the REST APIs at <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com" target="_blank">https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com</a>, a free online REST API with some fake data. 
We will use multiple endpoints to gather various types of data, such as users, posts, comments, albums, photos, and todos. By doing so, we will compose them into a single, unified GraphQL schema. 
This approach allows us to fetch and manipulate data in a more structured and flexible way compared to traditional REST APIs.

We can use the following formats to define our GraphQL schema: `.graphql`, `.yml`, `.json`.

You can find complete example configurations for the JSONPlaceholder API in the following formats:

- [GraphQL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tailcallhq/tailcall/main/examples/jsonplaceholder.graphql)
- [YAML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tailcallhq/tailcall/main/examples/jsonplaceholder.yml)
- [JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tailcallhq/tailcall/main/examples/jsonplaceholder.json)

These examples demonstrate how to set up a Tailcall configuration for a complex API with multiple interconnected resources. You can use these as a starting point for your own configurations.

To use one of these configurations, you can either copy the content directly into a local file, or download the file using a tool like `curl`. For example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tailcallhq/tailcall/main/examples/jsonplaceholder.graphql
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yml" label="YAML">

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tailcallhq/tailcall/main/examples/jsonplaceholder.yml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="json" label="JSON">

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tailcallhq/tailcall/main/examples/jsonplaceholder.json
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
The @call directive is used to chain multiple queries together. 
It allows the result of one query to be used as an argument for another query.
For example, in the Post type, the @call directive fetches the user who created the post 
by using the userId from the post as an argument for the user query.
The steps attribute is an array of query steps that are executed sequentially.
Each step specifies a query to be called and the arguments to be passed to it.
The `{{.value}}` placeholder is used to reference the result of the previous step in the chain.
:::


The above file is a standard `.graphQL` file, with some minor additions such as `@upstream` and `@http` directives. Basically we specify the GraphQL schema and how to resolve that GraphQL schema in the same file, without having to write any code!

## Starting the GraphQL server

Now, run the following command to start the server with the full path to the file that you created earlier.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="graphql">

```bash
tailcall start ./jsonplaceholder.graphql
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yml" label="yml">

```bash
tailcall start ./jsonplaceholder.yml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="json" label="json">

```bash
tailcall start ./jsonplaceholder.json
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If the command succeeds, you should see logs like the following below.

```bash
INFO File read: ./jsonplaceholder.graphql ... ok
INFO N + 1 detected: 0
INFO üöÄ Tailcall launched at [0.0.0.0:8000] over HTTP/1.1
INFO üåç Playground: https://tailcall.run/playground/?u=http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql
```

The server starts with the schema provided and prints out a load of meta information. We will cover those in detail in a bit. For now, open the **playground URL** in a new tab in your browser and try it out for yourself!

## Making GraphQL requests to the server

1. Open a web browser and go to [https://tailcall.run/playground/?u=http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql](https://tailcall.run/playground/?u=http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql). This should load the GraphiQL interface.
2. In the query editor of GraphiQL, enter the following query

   ```graphql showLineNumbers
   query {
     users {
       id
       name
       posts {
         title
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. After running the query in GraphiQL, expect to see a JSON response structured like this:

   ```json showLineNumbers
   {
     "data": {
       "users": [
         {
           "id": 1,
           "name": "Leanne Graham",
           "posts": [
             {
               "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi option reprehenderit"
             }
             // Posts truncated for brevity
           ]
         },
         {
           "id": 2,
           "name": "Ervin Howell",
           "posts": [
             {
               "title": "et ea vero quia laudantium autem"
             },
             {
               "title": "in quibusdam tempore odit est dolorem"
             }
             // Posts truncated for brevity
           ]
         }
         // Users truncated for brevity
       ]
     }
   }
   ```
